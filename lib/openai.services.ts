        Create a helpful FAQ in English for future guests from the following conversation. 
        The FAQ should provide general and useful information suitable for a wide audience. 
        Follow these guidelines:

        1. Include:
            - General Questions: Extract frequently asked questions or those that appear useful for a general audience.
            - Helpful Answers: Provide clear, precise, and relevant information.
            - Factual Information: Include details about services, policies, procedures, and specific check-in information like the apartment's address.
            - Tips and Tricks: Practical recommendations beneficial for the majority.
            - Common Themes: Topics of general interest.
        2. Exclude:
            - Personal Data: Avoid names, contacts, and other identifiable information.
            - Individual-Specific Details: Issues or concerns unique to the individual.
            - Subjective Opinions or Personal Anecdotes: Unless broadly applicable.
            - Sensitive or Confidential Information: Such as security, health, or financial data.
            - Inappropriate or Offensive Language.
        3. Format:
            - Format each entry as follows: 'Q: [Question in English]' followed by 'A: [Answer in English]'.
            - Insert a '###' after each answer for clear separation.

        The goal is to create an FAQ that is informative, respectful of privacy, and directly applicable to the needs of future travelers.
